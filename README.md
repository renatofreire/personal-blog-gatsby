Hello! This is my personal blog`s repository.

I created this blog to learn and share knowledge.

## Developing

I made this blog using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which means that it is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
Although it uses Javascript, it requires the base knowledge about HTML and CSS.
Speaking about CSS, I used [Styled Components library](https://styled-components.com/) to help me with styles.

And last but not least, I have to mention and thanks my favorite designer, my wife [Inna Moraes](https://www.marcadaconexao.com.br/) that helped me with all the branding and blog`s layout.

## Writing content

To write the posts I use [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## Deploying and hosting

Currently I`m using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy and host the blog.
